gets you to this dialogue:

![PNG that represents create new Attribute-Quicky dialogue](/doc/Create-Attribute-Quicky.png)

* Begin with a **name**, which is displayed in the issue context menue (right click menue) which should be short, concise and describes what it does
* Provide a **brief description**, which is shown in the attribute quickies list in the Attribute-Quickies tab in the project settings menue
* Optionally **Copy** all last attribute changes from an issue of this project, f.i.
  * status
  * assign to
  * priority
  * start date
  * due date
  
To copy last issue changes from an existing issue search the issue by subject or ID in the Issue-template field. Then press *Copy*. 
If a description change is detected you are provided with a drop down list. It lets you choose if the description change should be prepended, appended or if the new description should replace the description of the issue, on which Attribute-Quicky is applied with one click in the issue context menue.

Use the "**Only strict match**" option to only activate this Attribute-Quicky in the issue context menu, if the current issue's attributes match the prevoius attributes of the chosen template issue. 
*Example:* the template issue's attribute 'A' was changed from 'X' to 'Z'. Attribute-Quicky stores "Change 'A' from 'X' to 'Z'. 
If the current issue you want to apply the Attribute-Quicky on, has an attribute 'A' with value 'Y', then either a notice is shown next to the Attribute-Quicky in the context menu that after update the change from 'X' to 'Z' would not match or, if "**Only strict match**" is chosen, the Attribute-Quicky will be deactiavted. 
In case the current issue matches the previous attributes of the template issue, then no notice is shown.

* Optionally fill out **Log Time**
* Optionally choose **Assign to last author**
* Optionally choose **Add comment** and use all macros and issue comment function with full markdown / textile support
* Optionally **Add attachment** - above I added a picture of a friendly dolphin, which I think is a nice guy granting vacation requests

* Choose **Role** for which this Attribute-Quicky should be active, all or only certain roles
* Choose **Tracker** for which this Attribute-Quicky should be active, all or selected ones

**Save!**

Now you can right click an issue or on many issues at a time in the issue index view "View all issues" or "Custom query" and choose the Attribute-Quicky, which is displayed on top of the context menu. Click! All configured changes are applied to the issue. Ready!

Attribute-Quickies honor work-flow permissions and permissions per role, i.e. "View (use) Attribute-Quickies" and "Manage (admin) Attribute-Quickies"
